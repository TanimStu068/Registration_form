This is a simple registration form which contains the impormation from user include Name, Email, Date Of Birth, Phone, Password, gender etc.
I use the  ScrollView layout which contains all the TextView and Edittext, Button and RadioButton for Gender, and a CheckBox. And I also use RelativeLayout to set position and size child views.
